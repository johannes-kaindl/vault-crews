import { normalizeRelPath } from "./rel-path";

/** Which paths lie inside a folder, and the entries of a list that mean "this note" or "all notes in this folder". The same few
 *  lines stood in a dozen places, each with its own answer to four questions; the options below are those four questions, with
 *  the safe answer as the default. Pure string logic: it never reads a vault, and the paths come from the caller.
 *
 *  Origin, measured 2026-10-18 (all `startsWith(folder + "/")` underneath):
 *  - **koda-agent** `core/tools/write-policy.ts` (`inKoda`: both sides normalised, lower case, the folder itself counts),
 *    `core/tools/list.ts` `collectFolderNotes` (NFC, an empty folder is the root, direct children optional, sorted),
 *    `src/main.ts` `addContextFolder` and `expandNotizen` (an entry with `/` at the end is a folder, the rest a single path);
 *  - **obsidian-transmute** `core/vault/scope.ts` `inFolder` (slashes trimmed, an empty folder holds everything, direct children
 *    optional), **vault-crews** `obsidian/vault-port.ts` `listMarkdownFiles` (root holds everything, sorted) and `main.ts`
 *    (an empty root holds nothing), **llm-lab** `core/settings.ts` `pathsExcluded` (an empty folder is dropped first — "an
 *    empty string would be a prefix of every path and turn a typo into a silent plugin" — the folder itself counts),
 *    **mailstone** `import-eml.ts` (the folder itself counts), **paperless-storage** `cache-store.ts` and
 *    **kuro-gamification** `main.ts` (no normalising at all).
 *
 *  The four questions and the default:
 *  - *Does the folder itself count?* (`self`) Three versions said yes, six no. Default **no**: the paths asked about are notes.
 *  - *Does `Inbox` hold `inbox/a.md`?* (`ignoreCase`) Only write-policy compared lower case. Default **no**, as the vault does.
 *  - *Direct children only?* (`recursive`) transmute and koda's `list_notes` have both. Default **all depths**.
 *  - *Does an empty folder hold everything?* (`root`) Four versions said yes, five no or dropped the entry first. Default **no**:
 *    an empty setting that silently becomes "every file" is how `clear()` in paperless-storage would delete the whole vault; a
 *    caller that means the root says `root: true`. The same goes for `/`, `.` and `./`, which are the root spelled out.
 *
 *  What every call does on top, where the local versions differed: names are compared in Unicode normal form C — also a single
 *  entry of {@link expandPathEntries} (koda's `list` did; APFS and Obsidian's `normalizePath` treat a precomposed and a decomposed
 *  umlaut alike, the others did not); `ignoreCase` is `toLowerCase`, not case folding (dotted capital I, sharp s and a final sigma
 *  are not folded); both sides go through
 *  {@link normalizeRelPath} with a leading `/` stripped, so `/Inbox//./a.md` and `Inbox\a.md` are the same path; and a path or
 *  folder with a `..` segment or a NUL byte is **in no folder** (the local versions compared the text, so `a/../b` was "in `a`") —
 *  in the text reading; under `reading: "filesystem"` such a *path* is in every usable folder instead (below, "fail-closed").
 *  The paths that come back are the strings the caller gave, not the normalised ones. Sorting is by UTF-16 code unit, not by
 *  locale, so the order does not depend on the ICU version (koda's reason, stated in `list.ts`).
 *
 *  **No trimming of whitespace**: a name may start or end with a blank. A folder a user typed into a setting is trimmed by the
 *  caller first — llm-lab's `normalizePath` did, and without it `Privat ` no longer holds `Privat/x.md`, so an exclusion would
 *  silently stop excluding. A folder with a `/` at the end is the same folder here; llm-lab compared it against `Privat//` and
 *  matched nothing.
 *
 *  **`reading: "filesystem"` — the path as the strictest file system reads it.** The text reading above compares what was typed; a
 *  disk does not. Measured in the commit review of koda-agent (2026-10-18, `8f14f5b`, `4439e22`, task "folder-scope — Dateisystem-Lesart"):
 *  Windows drops blanks and dots at the end of a name (`Skills `, `Skills.` and `Skills . ` are `Skills`; a no-break space U+00A0 or
 *  U+202F counts as a blank) and reads everything from a `:` on as a data-stream suffix of the name before it (`Skills:x`,
 *  `Skills::$INDEX_ALLOCATION`); case-insensitive volumes fold by Unicode, not by ASCII (long s U+017F is `s`, the Kelvin sign U+212A
 *  is `k`, sharp s is `ss`). A path that passes the text reading as "not in `Skills`" can land in `Skills` on disk. Everyone who uses
 *  this module as a **write boundary** (a protected folder, an exclusion list, a delete scope) takes the filesystem reading for the
 *  folders it guards. Per segment, on both sides: `U+00A0`/`U+202F` to a blank, cut at the first `:`, strip blanks and dots at the
 *  end, NFKC, then upper and lower case in turn (which is full case folding: `ß` → `SS` → `ss`). `ignoreCase` is implied and
 *  ignored; `self`, `recursive` and `root` mean what they mean in the text reading, and a folder with `..` or NUL is unusable just the same
 *  (it holds nothing). A segment
 *  with nothing left after this (`...`, a lone blank, `:x`) drops out of the path like a `.` segment: whether a disk reads `...` as
 *  the folder itself or as a name of its own is **not measured here** (the .NET path rules recalled, not checked on Windows say it is
 *  a valid name), and the wider side is the safe one for a guarded folder. A folder
 *  that is nothing but such segments (`...`) is not the root: only the text reading places anything inside it.
 *  NFKC can turn a character into a dot or a separator (U+2025 into `..`, U+FF0F into `/`); a name for which it does is only
 *  case-folded, never read through NFKC. Patterns: only `*` and `**` wildcards are read correctly ({@link filesystemPath}); `:`, `{}` and `[]` in a pattern take the same rules as in a name.
 *
 *  **Fail-closed (0.36.0, a change of behaviour).** A *path* that cannot be read at all — a `..` segment or a NUL byte — is **inside every
 *  usable folder** under `reading: "filesystem"`, whatever `self` and `recursive` say, in {@link isInFolder}, {@link pathsInFolder} and
 *  {@link countInFolders} alike. Until 0.35.0 it was "in no folder", which is fail-open for a guard: `Privat/../x` slipped past an exclusion
 *  of `Privat`. A guard cannot tell where such a path would land, so it treats it as inside. Unchanged: a folder with `..` or NUL is
 *  unusable and stays empty (an unreadable path is not in it either); an empty folder without `root: true` holds nothing, the unreadable
 *  path included (an empty setting guards nothing — it does not turn into "everything"); the text reading answers `false` for an unreadable
 *  path as before, so an *allowed* zone (text reading) never takes one in. A caller that hands over paths from outside may still refuse
 *  `..` itself before the check; it no longer has to for the guard to hold.
 *
 *  **Which way to read depends on which way the boundary protects.** `reading: "filesystem"` answers "inside" if the filesystem
 *  reading OR the text reading (case-folded) says so, so it is the *wider* answer by construction — nothing the text puts inside a
 *  folder falls out — and it adds the spellings above. So: for a folder that is **guarded** (protected, excluded, never written
 *  without asking), a path is inside if `reading: "filesystem"` says so. For a zone that is **allowed** ("free to write here"), keep
 *  the text reading, the narrower one — `Koda /x.md` is not in `Koda`, even if Windows would put it there — and still ask the
 *  filesystem reading for each guarded subfolder, as koda's `writePolicy` does. Not covered: 8.3 short names (`PROGRA~1`), HFS+
 *  ignorable code points, and a volume that normalises differently from NFKC — NFKC is wider than any of them, which errs towards
 *  "inside".
 *  A boundary that is a list of **glob patterns** rather than folders (a deny list like `_crews/**`) uses {@link filesystemPath}: match each
 *  pattern against the path as given and against its filesystem reading, and read the patterns by the same segment rules, or the
 *  two sides are different spellings and nothing matches. The filesystem reading of a path can be its parent (`Koda/Skills/:x` is
 *  `Koda/Skills`): `Koda/Skills/**` does not match it, the path as given does — which is why both are matched.
 *
 *  Linear in the total length of the paths (plus the sort); {@link expandPathEntries} splits the list of known paths once, not
 *  once per entry, and {@link countInFolders} counts many folders in one pass over the paths. */
